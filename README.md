# Note
This training progress only support on LIVE II database now, the training progress on TID2013, CSIQ, LIVEMD, CLIVE will be released soon.

# Train
`python train.py`

# TODO
* Cross dataset test code will be published
* Train on different distortion types on LIVE, TID2013, CSIQ will be published
* Code of evaluations on Waterloo Exploration Database (D-test, L-test, P-test and gMAd competition) will be published
